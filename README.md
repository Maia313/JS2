## Design patterns:

#### Creational

* Constructor
* Factory  -  This makes an instance of several derived classes based on interfaced data or events.
* Abstract  -  Creates an instance of several families of classes without detailing concrete classes.
* Prototype  -  A fully initialized instance used for copying or cloning.
* Singleton  -  A class with only a single instance with global access points.
* Builder  -  Separates object construction from its representation, always creates the same type of object.

#### Structural

* Decorator
* Facade
* Flyweight
* Adapter
* Proxy

#### Behavioral

* Iterator
* Mediator
* Observer
* Visitor
